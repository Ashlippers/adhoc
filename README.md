# adhoc

This is a course project in Wireless Communication taught by Prof. Peter Steenkiste at PKU 2016 summer school.

This project aims to implement an ad-hoc network on real Linux computers, using on-demand routing and route maintenance. All the work is done in Application Layer but some of them are Link Layer issues, so this is only a simulation of what ad-hoc network should do.

Our code is based on a starting code by course TA.
